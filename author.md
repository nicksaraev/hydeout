<h1>Hi, I'm Nick.</h1>

{% include me.html %}

I co-founded [Let's Improve](https://www.google.ca) and [Savage Entertainment](https://www.google.ca).

I like to think of this website as a giant smattering of my thoughts over the last few years. It includes all of my writing on [neurotech](https://www.google.ca), [entrepreneurship](https://www.google.ca), [online teaching](https://www.google.ca), and [passive income](https://www.google.ca) to-date.

On top of that, it hosts my [projects](https://www.google.ca) - the apps, businesses, and organizations that I'm currently working on or have in the past.

If you're a potential employer/partner and you want to see a resume, [here you go](https://www.google.ca). But you'll probably get a much better feel for who I am by actually [reading my writing](https://www.google.ca).

I also have a mailing list, where I compile the best weekly reads on upcoming neurotechnologies. If you're interested in the industry, definitely join.

Talk soon,

Nick
